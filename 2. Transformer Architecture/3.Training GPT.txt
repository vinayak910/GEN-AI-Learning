Training of GPT 3 in steps



step 1 : Unsupervised learning 
--------------------------------

- the model is trained on data without explicit labels or annotations. The goal is to uncover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without any guidance from external sources.

Step 2 : Self Supervised learning
------------------------------------

-  the model generates its own supervisory signal from the input data. This means that instead of relying on external labels or annotations provided by humans

Ex : The cat sat on ___ . predicting the last word mat.


Step 3 : Fine tuning the model
---------------------------------

- These pre-trained models may not perform well on specific downstream tasks without further fine-tuning. 
- Fine-tuning involves continuing the training process on a smaller, task-specific dataset with labeled data. 
- The labeled data provides task-specific supervision to the model, allowing it to adapt to the specific task.

The other type of learning is prompt based learning.


The process of fine tuning is part of Transfer learning.
transfer learning is a broader concept that includes fine-tuning, fine-tuning is a specific type of transfer learning where the pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset.
